excerpt: "I am an Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Vanderbilt University with a minor in Digital Fabrication. This portfolio highlights hands-on projects where I design, build, and test functional prototypes using CAD, 3D-printing, embedded systems, and generative design. My projects include motorized systems, microfluidic devices, and generatively designed mechanical components, demonstrating my abilities in hands-on problem solving and iterative prototyping."
