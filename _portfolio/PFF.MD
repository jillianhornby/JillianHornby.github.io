# Introduction
## Pinched Flow Fractionation
Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a simple technique for continuously separating particles by size in microfluidic devices. PFF utilizes a “pinched section” where two fluids merge inside a narrow channel, with one containing particles and one particle-free buffer. By adjusting their flow rates, the particles are pushed against the sidewall of the pinched region. When the flow enters a wider “broad section,” the particles follow different paths according to their size, allowing them to be continuously separated into different outlets. 

## Applications of Pinched Flow Fractionation
PFF has many different applications, but it is of particular interest to the biomedical field because it enables continuous separation of biological particles by size in order to isolate and analyze them.  

In [one study](https://doi.org/10.1039/C5LC01014D), PFF was used to separate cancer cells from white blood cells with an accuracy of over 90%. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be shed from tumors and released into the bloodstream, which can result in metastasis. PFF presents an opportunity to isolate CTCs for cancer monitoring quickly and inexpensively compared to current methods.  

Even outside of the biomedical field, PFF can provide incredibly useful diagnostic information. 

# Design
## Sorting Geometry
The particles leaving the pinched region are described by the following relationship:

  Y<sub>0</sub> = (w<sub>p</sub> − D/2) · (w<sub>b</sub> / w<sub>p</sub>)
