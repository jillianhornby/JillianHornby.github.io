# Introduction
## Pinched Flow Fractionation
Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a simple technique for continuously separating particles by size in microfluidic devices. PFF utilizes a “pinched section” where two fluids merge inside a narrow channel, with one containing particles and one particle-free buffer. By adjusting their flow rates, the particles are pushed against the sidewall of the pinched region. When the flow enters a wider “broad section,” the particles follow different paths according to their size, allowing them to be continuously separated into different outlets. 

## Applications of Pinched Flow Fractionation


# Design
## Sorting Geometry

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Approach

## Flow Balancing Problem

## Future Improvments


# Instructions for Creating a Microfluidic Device with Resin Printing
1. Develop CAD model
2. Resin print the device
3. Post-process the print
4. Create PDMS mold
5. Test device and iterate


# Discussion
## Resin Printing vs. Other Manufacturing Techniques

## Parylene Coating

## Modifications for a Wider Range of Particle Sizes

## Lower Limit on Particle Size
