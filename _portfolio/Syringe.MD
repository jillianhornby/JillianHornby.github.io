# About
Syringe pumps have many applications, particularly in the medical field. This motorized syringe pump prototype can control multiple syringe pump sizes with custom flow rates for ease of use and a more precise output. This development of this project required designing custom 3D-printed parts, controlling a stepper-motor using an Arduino, making electrical connections, and assembling the final product. 

# Features

* **Custom Flow Rate.** The flow rate can be specified for each user for a custom experience. 
* **Holds two syringe sizes.** Special support pieces were developed in CAD to be able to securely hold two different sizes of syringe pumps for a more versatile product. 
* **LED Notification System.** An LED light outputs different colors depending on whether the syringe pump is on, off, or actively running.
