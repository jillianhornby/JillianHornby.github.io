# Print-in-Place Models
Print-in-place models are 3D designs composed of multiple moving parts printed as a single assembly. By carefully controlling clearances, these models can be used immediately after being removed from the print bed without any post-processing. However, these prints require very precise tolerances to allow motion or rotation, and they can come out poorly due to irregularities in filament printing. Adding flexible sections can greatly improve the performance of these designs and ensure parts can move as expected.  

Print-in-place models can be used to create functional parts made up of linked segments that move independently from one another, such as hinges or chain links. They are also used to create spring-loaded tools, such as pliers or trigger-based tools which require instantly returning to their initial position after being used. Print-in-place models are very beneficial for prototyping, because makers can test their designs quickly without having to spend time assembling multiple components.  

Due to irregularities when printing rigid materials, a combination of rigid and flexible materials is highly effective when creating print-in-place models. A stiff polymer such as PLA provides strength and dimensional accuracy for structural components, while a flexible elastomer like TPU can be used as a spring or a joint. Combining these materials allows for functional motion without the need for external fasteners or springs.  

# Multimaterial Pliers
This project focuses on designing and fabricating a pair of multimaterial needle nose pliers capable of gripping and picking up through-hole resistors. The design incorporates rigid handles and jaws for durability and precision, along with a flexible joint that enables the spring-like motion. The flexible center allows the pliers to automatically return to an open position when not in use, to follow the behavior of traditional spring-loaded pliers. This approach provides an efficient solution for developing pliers using filament 3D printing technology.
